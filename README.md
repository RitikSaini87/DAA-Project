# ✈️ Flight Route Planner using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This Python project is a GUI-based Flight Route Planner that helps users find the **cheapest flight path** between major Indian cities using **Dijkstra's algorithm**. The application provides an interactive interface built with **Tkinter**, and visualizes the graph using **Matplotlib** and **NetworkX**.
